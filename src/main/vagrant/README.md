fStream - Vagrant VirtualBox VM
===

Follow the directions outlined in this document to create, start, provision and export the fStream virtual machine (VM). Please see http://docs.icgc.org for operational instructions once the VM is up and running.

You may notice that the layout of the [`provisioning/`](provisioning) directory is highly structured and factored into many files. Although excessive for a single instance node such as the VM, the rationale for this decomposition is to promote reuse across projects and environments. This is mainly achieved using Ansible [roles](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks_roles.html) and [variables](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks_variables.html).

Furthermore, we may leverage Anisble to provision the system using other providers such as [`vagrant-aws`](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws), [`vagrant-openstack`](https://github.com/cloudbau/vagrant-openstack-plugin) and [`vagrant-kvm`](https://github.com/adrahon/vagrant-kvm).

Setup
---
The minimum requirements for creating the VM is VirtualBox (4.3+), Vagrant (1.3.5+) and Ansible (1.4+). You can find instructions on how to install each of these by following the links below.

## General:

- Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Install [Vagrant](http://downloads.vagrantup.com)
- Install [Ansible](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/intro_installation.html)

## MacOS:

- Install Vagrant and VirtualBox http://www.sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Vagrant/README.html
- Install Ansible https://devopsu.com/guides/ansible-mac-osx.html

*Note*: It is important that you _not_ install the external [`vagrant-anisble`](https://github.com/dsander/vagrant-ansible) plugin as this is deprecated and is already bundled with recent versions of Vagrant. Doing so may result in `python` Ansible class loading issues.

Provisioning
---
To create and provision the VM, clone the project, navigate to the `vagrant` directory and issue [`vagrant up`](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/up.html):
 
 	git clone git@github.com:icgc-dcc/dcc.git
 	cd dcc/dcc-submission/src/main/vagrant
	vagrant up

Ad Hoc Commands
---
Sometimes it may be convenient to issue [ad-hoc commands](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/intro_adhoc.html); something that you might type in to do something really quick, but don’t want to save for later. For example, in the [Vagrant environment](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/guide_vagrant.html#id5) you may issue the following command to print `$PWD`:

	ansible all -i provisioning/inventory -u vagrant --private-key ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -m shell -a 'pwd'

Exporting
---
After the VM is provisioned to taste, you may wish to [export the instance](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-export) as an appliance. Doing so will result in standard [`OVA`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format) file that is portable and convenient for end users to [consume using VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html#ovf). To start the export process, issue the following command to export the appliance:

	VBoxManage export dcc-validator-vm -o dcc-valiator-vm.ova --vsys 0 --product "DCC Validator VM 2.x"
